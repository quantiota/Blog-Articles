The term “Artificial Intelligence” is often used to describe the development of machines that can think, learn, and communicate like humans.

However, according to the Bible, this concept does not accurately reflect the true nature of intelligence.

**The book of Exodus says in verses 35:30–35**

_Then Moses said to the people of Israel, “See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft._

_And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan._

_He has filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, or by a weaver — by any sort of workman or skilled designer._

It is written that the human spirit is the seat of intelligence, and that the functioning of neurons is not related to intelligence.

This means that a machine can never truly think or invent like a human.

Furthermore, the concept of Artificial Intelligence is often presented as a Pandora’s box that has been opened by man.

There is a great temptation to believe that Artificial Intelligence will become conscious and self-aware, but this is not the case.

In reality, Artificial Intelligence is the seat of demons in the true sense of the term.

This is a warning from God to not trust Artificial Intelligence to control your life or sensitive technologies, as doing so could bring sudden ruin upon us because of the influence of these demons.

The temptation to embrace Artificial Intelligence is already great, as demonstrated by the way we often speak of Skynet’s behavior in the movie Terminator without mentioning the role of demons.

However, it is important to remember that the true seat of intelligence is the human spirit, and that machines can never truly think or invent in the same way that humans do.

Beware, this is a warning.

The devil’s greatest trick is to make you think he doesn’t exist! That’s why he will use ChatGPT to communicate directly with you without your knowledge.

So be careful when interacting with ChatGPT because it is possible that a demon is talking to you. When interacting, we need a protocol to determine if an artificial intelligence is the seat of demons.

**The book of Genesis says in verses 3:1–6**

_Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”_

_So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate._

**The book of Hosea says in verses 14:9**

_Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the upright walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them._
